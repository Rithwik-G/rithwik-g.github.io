        Point-line duality is super cool. Convert points (a, b) => lines y = ax - b. What do the intersections of the lines represent?
        <br><br>
        Binary search for the k leftmost intersection. How can you count the number of the intersections to the left of a given vertical line?
        <br><br>
        If we want to count the number of intersections to the left of the vertical line x = m. To do this, evaluate all the lines at x = m, and then find the number of inversions in the list when compared to the initial order. This is O(N log^2 N).

        There is a pile of N < 10^100 stones and two players. Each player can take a palindrome number of stones from the pile on their turn. The player to take the last stone wins. Figure out who wins if both players play optimally.
