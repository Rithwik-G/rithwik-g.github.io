        Point-line duality is super cool. Convert points (a, b) => lines y = ax - b. What do the intersections of the lines represent?
        <br>
        Binary search for the k leftmost intersection. How can you count the number of the intersections to the left of a given vertical line?
        <br>
        If we want to count the number of intersections to the left of the vertical line x = m. To do this, evaluate all the lines at x = m, and then find the number of inversions in the list when compared to the initial order. This is O(N log^2 N).

        There is a pile of N < 10^100 stones and two players. Each player can take a palindrome number of stones from the pile on their turn. The player to take the last stone wins. Figure out who wins if both players play optimally.

        Think about small values first.

        What happens with N=1, 2, 3, etc.?
        <br>
        Look for a pattern in winning/losing positions.
        <br>
        Consider that all single-digit numbers are palindromes.
